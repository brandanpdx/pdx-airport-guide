      <h1>Security Checkpoints</h1>
      <p>All passengers must present Transportation Security Administration checkpoint staff with an airline-issued
        boarding pass, and passengers age 18 or older must present government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's
        license or passport.

        At the airport a boarding pass may be obtained at one of the following locations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> - Your airline's ticket counter</li>
        <li> - Your airline's self-service ticket kiosks</li>
        <li> - Your airline's curbside check-in station</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>You have a choice between the north and south security checkpoints – regardless of where your flight departs.
        The Concourse Connector joins all the PDX concourses and allows you to select the shortest security line.</p>

    <h1>Traveling with Marijuana</h1>
    <h4>Recreational Marijuana</h4>
    <p>Recreational marijuana is not permitted to be transported out of Oregon. While decriminalized in Oregon (and some other states), possession of recreational marijuana is still considered a federal crime, as is the transport of marijuana over state lines. For this reason, PDX Rules prohibit the possession of marijuana past the security check points for travelers destined for points outside the state of Oregon. </p>
    <h4>Medical Marijuana</h4>
    <p>The Port Police will not seize marijuana from travelers when traveling out of PDX if you hold a valid Oregon Medical Marijuana card and you are not carrying a quantity that exceeds an amount that you are lawfully authorized to possess. If you are traveling to a destination outside of Oregon, upon arrival you are subject to laws in that state.</p>

    <h1>Prohibited Items</h1>
    <p>To enhance security and speed you through the security screening process, the TSA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and/or airlines prohibit some items in your checked and carry-on luggage.</p>
    <h4>Liquids, Gels and Aerosols</h4>
    <p>Liquids, gels or aerosols are only allowed in limited quantities in your carry-on luggage. Each traveler is allowed to take 1 quart-sized, clear plastic, zip-top bag holding 3.4 ounces (100 ml) or smaller “containers” of liquids and gel-like items such as shampoo and toothpaste.</p>
    <h4>Sharp Objects</h4>
    <p>Many sharp objects and other items that may be used as weapons are not allowed in your carry-on luggage or past the security checkpoints.</p>
    <h4>Electronic Cigarettes (E-cigarettes), Vaping Devices and Spare Lithium Batteries</h4>
    <p>The FAA prohibits e-cigarettes and vaping devices in checked luggage due to the fire hazard posed by the lithium batteries used in these devices. These devices may only be carried in the aircraft cabin (in carry-on baggage or on your person). They may not be used or charged on the aircraft. When a carry-on bag is checked at the gate or planeside, all e-cigarettes and vaping devices, along with any spare lithium batteries, must be removed from the bag and kept with the passenger in the aircraft cabin.</p>
    <h4>Other Prohibited Items</h4>
    <p>Check the TSA website for the latest restrictions and a more comprehensive list of prohibited items. For questions regarding specific items call PDX TSA Customer Service at 503.889.3067.</p>
